# YoAudioEditor

Depends on [YoAudio](https://github.com/chtammik/YoAudio) library.

This repo contains a simple sandbox to run the YoAudio engine and test it's capabilities. To use simply clone this repo into a folder adjacent to the YoAudio repo. On every build the editor will copy the YoAudio.dll to it's build folder.
